  <h1>Guitar-Simulator Demo</h1>
  <p>
    This demo simulates 4 strings of a guitar,
    each mapped to one row of keys on your keyboard:
    <ul>
      <li>The e string on the number row (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)</li>
      <li>The b string on the next row (Q, W, E, R, ...)</li>
      <li>The g string on the next row (A, S, D, F, ...)</li>
      <li>The d string on the next row (Z, X, C, V, ...)</li>
    </ul>
    Your keyboard layout may differ.
    In any case, the effect of pressing a key should be determined by its
    position, not the associated character.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first key in each row plays the open string while the subsequent
    keys correspond to the frets.
    Note that key shapes and positions at the right ends of the rows
    vary across keyboards.
    So there the mapping from keys to notes might not fully fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    A string is "picked" by pressing a key
    and the corresponding note will play until
    you release the key,
    you press another key for the same string,
    or the string's vibration has faded out after some time.
    While you cannot play more than one note at a time on a single string,
    it is possible to play multiple notes on different strings simultaneously
    (as far as your keyboard properly reports multiple key presses/releases).
  </p>
  <p>
    For each string the currently playing note is displayed
    in one of the boxes to the right.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most browsers do not allow web pages to emit sound
    before you have interacted with the page
    (and keyboard input does not count).
    So click this button to enable audio output:

  <h2>Implementation notes</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this demo was to experiment with sound generation
    in an <code>AudioWorkletNode</code>.
    (See <a href="https://github.com/hcschuetz/guitar-simulation/blob/main/index.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
    for the main JavaScript code and
    <a href="https://github.com/hcschuetz/guitar-simulation/blob/main/StringWorklet.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
    for the worklet processor code.  Furthermore
    <a href="https://github.com/hcschuetz/guitar-simulation/blob/main/note-display.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
    is the code for drawing the notes.)
  </p>
  <p>
    There is one long-lived worklet node per string.  Picking and damping
    works by sending messages.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code simulates a string sound
    by superimposing multiple partials, each of which is a decaying sine wave.
    While the actual sound generation by the worklet processor
    happens in the audio thread, 
    the parameters are calculated in the main JS thread.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with real guitar strings higher partials decay faster than lower ones.
    So over time a picked string changes
    from an overtone-rich sound towards a pure sine wave.
    You can play with the sound generator code to create even more realistic
    string sounds or sounds of completely different instruments.
  </p>

  <h2>Tweaking overtones</h2>
  <p>
    To make intervals in 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet) sound more consonant,
    we can tweak the overtones
    so that their frequency ratios to the base frequency are powers of
    <math>
      <mroot>
        <mi>2</mi>
        <mn>12</mn>
      </mroot>
    </math>.
  Of course this deviates from the behavior of a physical guitar.

    <summary>Background</summary>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretched_tuning">Stretched
        tuning</a> adapts scale intervals to the
      non-integer frequency ratios of the overtones of low-pitch piano strings.
      This brought me to the idea that in digital sound generation
      we can also do the opposite,
      namely adapt the overtones to the scale intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out that this idea is not at all new.
      It is demonstrated for example in the video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUwC4syOX1s"><em>Benedetti's
        Puzzle SOLVED</em></a> by NewTonality
      and described in the paper
      <a href="https://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/paperspdf/specspec97.pdf">
        <em>Specifying spectra for musical scales</em></a>
      by William A.&nbsp;Sethares and in section 12.3.2 of his book
      <a href="https://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/ttss.html"><em>Tuning Timbre
        Spectrum Scale</em></a>.
      According to the latter,
      Hammond organs actually use these tweaked overtones.
